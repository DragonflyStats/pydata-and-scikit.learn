\frametitle{eye, identity}
\texttt{eye} generates an identity array â€“ an array with ones on the diagonal, zeros everywhere else. Normally,
an identity array is square and so usually only 1 input is required. More complex zero-padded arrays
containing an identity matrix can be produced using optional inputs.

identity is a virtually identical function with similar use, In = identity(N).
