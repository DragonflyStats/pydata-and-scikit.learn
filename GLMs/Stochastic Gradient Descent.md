Stochastic Gradient Descent - SGD
====================================
- Stochastic gradient descent is a simple yet very efficient approach to fit linear models. 
- It is particularly useful when the number of samples (and the number of features) is very large.
- The classes SGDClassifier and SGDRegressor provide functionality to fit linear models for classification and regression using different (convex) loss functions and different penalties.
