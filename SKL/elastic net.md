Elastic Net
==============================

ElasticNet is a linear model trained with L1 and L2 prior as regularizer. 

This combination allows for learning a sparse model where few of the weights are non-zero like Lasso, while still maintaining the the regularization properties of Ridge. We control this tradeoff using the l1_ratio parameter.
Elastic-net is useful when there are multiple features which are correlated with one another. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random, while elastic-net is likely to pick both.
A practical advantage of trading-off between Lasso and Ridge is it allows Elastic-Net to inherit some of Ridgeâ€™s stability under rotation.
