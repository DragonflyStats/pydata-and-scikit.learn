# The scikit-learn deals with learning information from one or more datasets that are represented as 2D arrays. 
# They can be understood as a list of multi-dimensional observations.

# IRIS

# The iris dataset is a classification task consisting in identifying 3 different types 
# of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) from their petal and sepal length and width:
