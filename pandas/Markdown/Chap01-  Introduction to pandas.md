pandas
============
pandas is the utility belt for data analysts using python. The package centers around the pandas DataFrame, a two-dimensional data structure with indexable rows and columns. 

It has effectively taken the best parts of Base R, R packages like plyr and reshape2 and consolidated them into a single library.

Library highlights include:
- DataFrame
- Indexable rows and columns (e.g. selecting columns and rows via column/row names)
- Boolean indexing
- Graceful treatment of missing or NA values
- Broadcasting (i.e. calling a function on an entire row or column without iteration)
- Outstanding split, apply, combine, groupby functionality
- Simple yet powerful string manipulation (again, applied over a large number of strings)
- Built-in summary statistics (mean, std, corr, etc.)
- Merging, joining, data set concatenation
