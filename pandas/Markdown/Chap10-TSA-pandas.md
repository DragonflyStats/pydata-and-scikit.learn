#### Timeseries with pandas
Working with time-series data is an important part of data analysis.

Starting with v0.8, the pandas library has included a rich API for time-series manipulations.

The pandas time-series API includes:

- Creating date ranges
- From files
- From scratch
- Manipulations: Shift, resample, filter
- Field accessors (e.g., hour of day)
- Plotting
- Time zones (localization and conversion)
- Dual representations (point-in-time vs interval)
