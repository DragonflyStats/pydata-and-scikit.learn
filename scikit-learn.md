scikit-learn
===================================
- scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn) is an open source machine learning library for the Python programming language. 
- It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including 
 - support vector machines, 
 - logistic regression, 
 - naive Bayes, 
 - random forests, 
 - gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN.
- scikit-learn is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
- scikit-learn is largely written in Python, with some core algorithms written in Cython to achieve performance. Support vector machines are implemented by a Cython wrapper around LIBSVM. 
- Logistic Regression and Linear support vector machines are implemented by a Cython wrapper around LIBLINEAR.
